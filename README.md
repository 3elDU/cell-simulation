# Cell evolution

Evolution simulation, written in C

### Dependencies
- SDL2
- SDL2_image

### Platforms
- Linux
- macOS

### Building and running
```sh
git clone https://github.com/3elDU/cell-simulation.git
cd cell-simulation
make
./cells
```

### Keys
- S - save simulation to the file ( save.bin by default, but you can change it in main.c )
- L - load simulation from the file.
- Space - pause/unpause
- F - step simulation by one frame
- H - toggle headless mode ( don't render anything )
- R - reload the map
- Left mouse button on the cell to save it to the file
- Right mouse button to load cell from the file ( enter filename in the terminal )
- 1 - energy rendering more ( more energy - more yellow )
- 2 - relatives rendering more ( relaives have similar color. it changes a bit with each mutation )
- 3 - age rendering mode ( more age - more blue )
- 4 - energy source rendering mode ( red - eating other cells, green - photosynthesis, blue - dead cells, white - mixed )

### Code architecture
Some variables can be configured at compile-time. They are located in `src/defines.h`.
You can change `SIMULATION_WIDTH` and `SIMULATION_HEIGHT` to fit your computer power or other needs.
If the window is too big or too small, you can change `CELL_WIDTH` and `CELL_HEIGHT`.
Every cell is like a tiny virtual machine. It has its own memory ( genome ), instruction pointer, and all cell-like things.
It can move, generate energy, eat other cells, reproduct. There are even conditional jumps.
Everything works because of [natural selection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_selection).
When cell makes it's own copy, there's a chan—Åe for each gene to mutate ( as said earlier, you can change it in `src/defines.h` ).
So, child will be different from it's parent, and so on. There's a lot of cells, so at least some will have "lucky" enough genome to survive.
They evolve, reproduct, kill each other, and do all that "live" things. Since everything is written in C, simulation runs very smoothly.
